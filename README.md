Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

This repository showcases the Loan Approval Prediction project, which is part of my data science portfolio.

Problem Statement
"Dream Housing Finance" is a company that specializes in home loans, with a presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. 
Customers apply for home loans, and the company verifies their eligibility for approval. 
To streamline this process, the company wants to automate the loan eligibility decision in real-time based on customer details provided in the online application form.
These details include factors such as gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and more.


Goal of the project
The goal is to predict whether a customer qualifies for a loan, allowing the company to target eligible customers more effectively.

Loan prediction is a prevalent problem faced by retail banks in their lending operations.
Automating this process would not only save significant man-hours but also speed up service delivery to customers. 
This can greatly enhance customer satisfaction while reducing operational costs.
However, the benefits can only be realized if the bank has a reliable model to accurately predict
which loans should be approved and which should be rejected, minimizing the risk of loan defaults.
