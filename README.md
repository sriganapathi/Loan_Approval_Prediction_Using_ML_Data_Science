# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

This repository showcases the Loan Approval Prediction project, which is part of my data science portfolio.

## Problem Statement:

"Dream Housing Finance" is a company that specializes in home loans, with a presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas Customers apply for home loans, and the company verifies their eligibility for approval. To streamline this process, the company wants to automate the loan eligibility decision in real-time based on customer details provided in the online application form. These details include factors such as gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and more.

## Goal of the project:

The goal is to predict whether a customer qualifies for a loan, allowing the company to target eligible customers more effectively.

## Attributes in the dataset:

   1. Loan id
   2. Gender
   3. Married
   4. Dependents
   5. Education
   6. Self Employed
   7. Applicant income
   8. Coapplicant income
   9. Loan Amount
  10. Credit History, 
  11. Property_Area
  12. Loan_Status

## Technologies:

  * Python 
  * Scikit-Learn
  * Tensorflow
  * Keras 
  * Pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * missingno 
  * Anaconda Tool 
  * Jupyter_notebook
  * seaborn
  
## ML Algorithms: 

   * Support Vector Machine
   * Random Forest
   * Linear Regression
   * Decision Tree
   * Naive Bayes
   * K-Nearest Neighbors
   * XG Boost

## Steps involved in the Project: 

  1. Dataset
  2. Data Preprocessing
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  4. Splitting the Data 
  5. Using Machine learning models 
  6. Training and Evaluation 
  7. Check the accuracy score 
  8. Saving the Model 
  9. compare the ML models 
 10. Get the input from user 
 11. applying the model 
 12. Predict the result
